As well as this the kernel_opt_file contains the following list of functions developed for the study:
- Custom MAPE function which accounts for small true values.
- Percentage of small values function  which shows what percentage of true values is close to zero (useful to understanding high MAPE values).
- Sobol sampling function.
- Kernel to string function which enables kernels to be outputted as its names.
- Find best kernel function is *the kernel optimisation function* developed for this study utilising greedy tree search to find the best composite kernel based on MAE.
